    What is it?
    ==========
    
       This is a small simple player used to demonstrate the HuPCM driver. It uses a modified
      XM file, turnicated right after the patterns section, with extracted wave files converted
      to HuPCM compatible format. This player is only meant to demonstrate how to use the PCM
      playback driver. See the example code directly for full implementation.
